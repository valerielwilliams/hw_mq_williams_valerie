##Resources
Here are the resources that I used to complete this assignment: 

* [CSS @media Rule at W3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp)
	* I used the *Try It Yourself* feature to test the CSS that I used on the Combo branch. 

* [Git Basics - Tagging] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)
 * The *Checking out Tags* topic taught me how to add a tag to a branch that I'm creating.

* [PANTONE Color of the Year 2017](http://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2017)
 * This is where I got the inspiration for the background colors that I used throughout the assignment.

 ##Comments
 
This was really cool. I liked this a lot more than JavaScript.
